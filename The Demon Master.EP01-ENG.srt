Revenge?

191
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,440
Don't you think

192
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,840
I could be used easily?

193
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,760
Look at your face

194
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,080
You!

195
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:42,800
Stop it!

196
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,360
Stop it!

197
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,560
Why did you so stupid?

198
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,080
How could you take
a drink from a stranger?

199
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,360
The waiter served it to me

200
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,720
I didn't know it will happen

201
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,320
Are you a stupid?

202
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,000
Don't you know how many girls

203
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,040
was cheated because of it?

204
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,920
I'm a stupid and you're smart

205
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,000
Don't you know how
dangerous a lady walking alone?

206
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,079
When I was coming out from the hotel,

207
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,160
you didn't even go after me

208
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,920
It's obvious that
you're not caring of me

209
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:14,800
I was...

210
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,440
I was too angry at that time

211
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,280
Moreover,

212
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,680
I tried to look for you right after

213
00:17:21,118 --> 00:17:21,999
Have you thought about it?

214
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,960
What if I was kidnapped?

215
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,000
Are you blaming me?

216
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:26,280
Did I chase you out?

217
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,880
You misunderstood that I was

218
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:28,920
having affair with the foreign lady

219
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:29,920
You're the one wanted to leave

220
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,640
Who asked for break-up?

221
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,840
I meant no point we stay together
if we don't believe each other

222
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:34,920
You're the one who asked for break-up

223
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,240
Alright, I'm the one who screwed it up

224
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:50,920
Did you care about my feeling

225
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:51,920
when you're holding

226
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,960
the foreign lady?

227
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,760
And you wronged me that
I was having affair with the guy

228
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,240
What are you doing?

229
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:00,240
I thought you knew about it

230
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:03,760
Where is your ring?

231
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,480
I was wearing it last night

232
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,360
It's just a small fight

233
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,760
How could you throw the ring?

234
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,960
You never take serious
for our engagement

235
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,120
That's great

236
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,560
Well, the God thinks that

237
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,600
we're not suitable for each other

238
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:22,720
An Chu Xia

239
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,240
Can't you be rational?

240
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,840
I thought it was just a small fight

241
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:26,520
and we could...

242
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:27,360
Let's break up

243
00:18:33,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's up to you
